#  Set of solved thread management problems in the Unix/Linux operating system

11: Creates two threads using the POSIX pthread library. The first thread performs an arithmetic calculationâ€”in this case, summing the numbers from 1 to 100. The second thread waits until the calculation is complete and then displays the result.

12: Demonstrates how threads can cooperate to perform different tasks concurrently, and how the main process can synchronize with these threads to collect and display the results.
